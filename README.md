# Machine-Learning-Challenge

 create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset

 you will need to:

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)


### Preprocess the Data

* Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.

### Tune Model Parameters

* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.

### Reporting

* Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).

Required: 

* Create a Jupyter Notebook for each model and host the notebooks on GitHub.

* Create a file for your best model and push to GitHub

* Include a README.md file that summarizes your assumptions and findings.

* Submit the link to your GitHub project to Bootcamp Spot.
